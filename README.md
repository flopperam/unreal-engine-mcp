## Featured Capabilities

```bash
# Create a massive futuristic city with skyscrapers, flying cars, and advanced infrastructure
> "Build a massive futuristic city with towering skyscrapers"
→ create_town(town_size="massive", architectural_style="futuristic", building_density=0.95, include_advanced_features=true)
```

### Advanced Structures  
```bash
# Build complex multi-room houses with windows, doors, and roofs
> "Create a Victorian mansion complex with east and west wing houses."
→ construct_house(house_style="mansion", width=1500, height=900)
```

### Intelligent Mazes
```bash
# Generate solvable mazes with guaranteed paths using recursive backtracking
> "Make a 15x15 maze with high walls"
→ create_maze(rows=15, cols=15, wall_height=4, cell_size=250)
```

## ⚡ Lightning-Fast Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Unreal Engine 5.5+** 
- **Python 3.12+**
- **MCP Client** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Windsurf)

### 1. Setup Options

**Option A: Use the Pre-Built Project (Recommended for Quick Start)**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/flopperam/unreal-engine-mcp.git
cd unreal-engine-mcp

# Open the pre-configured project
# Double-click FlopperamUnrealMCP/FlopperamUnrealMCP.uproject
# or open it through Unreal Engine launcher

# The plugin is already installed and enabled!
```

**Option B: Add Plugin to Your Existing Project**
```bash
# Copy the plugin to your project
cp -r UnrealMCP/ YourProject/Plugins/

# Enable in Unreal Editor
Edit → Plugins → Search "UnrealMCP" → Enable → Restart Editor
```

**Option C: Install for All Projects**
```bash
# Copy to Engine plugins folder (available to all projects)
cp -r UnrealMCP/ "C:/Program Files/Epic Games/UE_5.5/Engine/Plugins/"

# Enable in any project through the Plugin Browser
Edit → Plugins → Search "UnrealMCP" → Enable
```

### 2. Launch the MCP Server

```bash
cd Python
uv run unreal_mcp_server_advanced.py
```

### 3. Configure Your AI Client

Add this to your MCP configuration:

**Cursor**: `.cursor/mcp.json`
**Claude Desktop**: `~/.config/claude-desktop/mcp.json`
**Windsurf**: `~/.config/windsurf/mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unrealMCP": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/unreal-engine-mcp/Python",
        "run",
        "unreal_mcp_server_advanced.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **🎯 Want to program Blueprints with AI?** Check our [Blueprint Graph Programming Guide](Guides/blueprint-graph-guide.md) to learn how to create nodes, connections, and variables programmatically.

### Recommended AI Model

**We strongly recommend using Claude for the best experience.**

Claude has proven to be the most effective AI model for:
- Understanding complex 3D spatial relationships
- Generating accurate MCP tool calls
- Following architectural and physics constraints
- Creating coherent multi-step building processes

### Enhanced Accuracy with Rules

For improved results, especially when creating specific types of objects, provide the AI with our curated rules:

- **`.cursor/rules/`** - Contains specialized guides for different creation tasks

### 4. Start Building!

```bash
> "Create a medieval castle with towers and walls"
> "Generate a town square with fountain and buildings"
> "Make a challenging maze for players to solve"
```
